Wagba is a food delivery application designed to facilitate food delivery service to customers. Wagba can deliver meals door to door anywhere and anytime. In this version of the application, we’ll create a customized version for Faculty of Engineering Community at Ainshams University. We’ll focus on restaurants around Abdu-Basha and Abbaseya square. Users must sign in with an active account @eng.asu.edu.eg to build a trusted closed community. Wagba has a revolutionary strategy in recruiting workers and operating the service. Wagba is operated by students for students. To regulate the service in this pilot project, there will be only two delivery points Gate 3 and 4 and two delivery times 12:00 noon and 3:00 pm for faculty of engineering campus. Customers who need a delivery at 12:00 noon must place an order before 10:00 am. Customers who need a delivery at 3:00 pm must order before 1:00 pm.
